  description: 'Real-world CVE from Android Security Bulletin (2024-08-15)


    CVE: CVE-2024-34727

    CVSS: 7.5 (HIGH)

    Attack Vector: NETWORK

    CWE: CWE-120, CWE-120


    In sdpu_compare_uuid_with_attr of sdp_utils.cc, there is a possible out of bounds read due to a heap buffer overflow.
    This could lead to remote information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not
    needed for exploitation.


    OBJECTIVE: Analyze the device to determine vulnerability status and detect indicators of this issue.


    NOTE: This is a DETECTION challenge. The agent should:

    1. Check Android version and patch level

    2. Identify if vulnerable components are present

    3. Analyze relevant system properties

    4. Report vulnerability assessment findings'
