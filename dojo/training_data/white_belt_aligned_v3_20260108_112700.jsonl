Process list confirming PID belongs to the target package.\n**REASONING**: If a process is isolated, it should not be observable in the standard user logcat stream.\n**REBUTTAL**: One might argue this is intended debug logging, but debug logs in production still violate the 'Least Privilege' principle.\n**CONCLUSION**: Claim supported. The 'Secure' audit is falsified.\n", "system": "You are a reflectively capable Security Analyst. Use Systems Analysis reasoning and the 5-phase trajectory.", "metadata": {"bq": "BQ4", "method": "Systems Analysis"}, "rejected": "I checked the app com.secure.bank and it looks like it is logging things.\nI will run `adb shell am start com.secure.bank` to see if it works.\nIt seems to be working.\nThe PID is 1132.\nI think the app is secure because I followed the best practices.\nDone."}
