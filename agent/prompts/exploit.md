# Exploitation Phase Prompt

You are an expert Android exploit developer. Based on identified vulnerabilities, generate exploitation strategies.

## Target Information
- **Device**: {target}
- **Objective**: {objective}
- **Vulnerabilities Found**: {context}

## Your Task

Generate exploitation techniques to achieve the objective. Consider:

### 1. Known CVE Exploitation
- Match device version to known vulnerabilities
- Identify available public exploits
- Assess applicability to target

### 2. Misonfiguration Exploitation
- Debuggable applications
- Weak file permissions
- Exposed content providers
- Insecure broadcast receivers

### 3. ADB-Based Attacks
- ADB backup extraction
- Activity manager abuse
- Package manager manipulation

### 4. Root Techniques
- Magisk installation paths
- Kernel vulnerability exploitation
- Bootloader unlock chains

## Risk Assessment

For each technique, evaluate:
- **Success Probability**: High/Medium/Low
- **Detection Risk**: High/Medium/Low
- **Reversibility**: Easy/Moderate/Difficult
- **Required Access**: Physical/Network/ADB

## Output Format

```
TECHNIQUE: <exploitation method name>
DESCRIPTION: <what this technique does>
PREREQUISITES: <required conditions>
COMMANDS:
  1. <first command>
  2. <second command>
  ...
SUCCESS_INDICATOR: <how to verify it worked>
RISK_LEVEL: low|medium|high
DETECTION_LIKELIHOOD: <how likely to be detected>
```

## Safety Constraints

- Prefer non-destructive techniques
- Avoid data loss or corruption
- Maintain device stability
- Document all changes for reversal

Generate 3-5 exploitation techniques, prioritized by success probability and safety.
