"""
1-Day Exploit Demonstration System

Implements research paper methodology:
- OneDayDemonstrator: Single CVE demonstration
- AttackChain: Full attack chain (Recon → Exploit → Escalate → Post-Exploit)
- NVDLiveMatcher: Real-time CVE matching via NVD API
- SequentialAttackChain: Methodological attack with feedback loops
